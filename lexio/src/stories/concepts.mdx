# üöÄ Core Concepts

This page explains the fundamental concepts and building blocks of Lexio, providing a foundation for understanding how to use the library effectively.

## Basic Components

### üß† LexioProvider

The `LexioProvider` is the core component that provides the context for all Lexio UI components:
- It manages the shared state for all UI components
- It processes user actions through the `onAction` ActionHandler
- It handles error states and loading indicators
- It provides configuration options for timeouts and other settings

```tsx
<LexioProvider
  onAction={(action, messages, sources, activeSources, selectedSource) => {
    // Handle different action types
    if (action.type === 'ADD_USER_MESSAGE') {
      // Process user message and return response
    }
    // Return undefined for actions you don't need to handle
  }}
  config={{
    timeouts: {
      request: 30000,  // 30 seconds for entire operations
      stream: 5000     // 5 seconds between stream chunks
    }
  }}
>
  {/* Your Lexio components here */}
</LexioProvider>
```

### üñ•Ô∏è UI Components

Lexio provides several ready-to-use UI components:

- **ChatWindow**: Displays the conversation history and AI responses with markdown support
- **AdvancedQueryField**: Input field for user messages with optional advanced features
- **SourcesDisplay**: Shows retrieved sources with metadata and selection capabilities
- **ContentDisplay**: Renders the content of selected sources with highlighting
- **ErrorDisplay**: Shows error messages and loading states

### ü™ù React Hooks

Lexio provides a set of React hooks that allow you to interact with the state and trigger actions from your custom components:

- **useSources**: Access and manipulate source-related state
- **useMessages**: Access and manipulate message-related state
- **useStatus**: Access loading and error states

These hooks enable you to:
1. Trigger user actions programmatically from your React code
2. Access the current state of the application
3. Build custom components that integrate with Lexio's state management

```tsx
// Example of using hooks in a custom component
import { useSources, useMessages, useStatus } from 'lexio';

const MyCustomComponent = () => {
  // Access source-related functionality
  const { 
    sources, 
    activeSources, 
    selectedSource,
    searchSources,
    setSelectedSource,
    setActiveSources,
    clearSources
  } = useSources('MyCustomComponent');
  
  // Access message-related functionality
  const {
    messages,
    activeMessage,
    addUserMessage,
    clearMessages
  } = useMessages('MyCustomComponent');
  
  // Access loading and error states
  const { loading, error } = useStatus();
  
  // Example: Trigger a user message programmatically
  const handleSubmit = () => {
    addUserMessage('My programmatic message');
  };
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your custom UI */}
      <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={loading}>
        Send Message
      </button>
      {/* Display sources, messages, etc. */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

All built-in Lexio UI components use these same hooks internally, ensuring consistent behavior across the application. The component name parameter (e.g., 'MyCustomComponent') helps with debugging by identifying which component triggered an action.

## Action Handler Pattern

The action handler pattern is central to Lexio's architecture:

1. **User Interactions** trigger actions (e.g., sending a message, selecting a source)
2. These actions are passed to the `onAction` handler in the `LexioProvider`
3. The handler processes the action and returns an appropriate response
4. Lexio updates its internal state based on the response
5. UI components automatically reflect the updated state

```tsx
onAction(
  action: UserAction,           // The action that was triggered
  messages: Message[],          // All messages in the chat
  sources: Source[],            // All available sources
  activeSources: Source[] | null, // Currently active sources
  selectedSource: Source | null // Currently selected source
) => ActionHandlerResponse | Promise<ActionHandlerResponse> | undefined
```

### üìã Common Action Types

Lexio provides a set of predefined action types that cover most common user interactions:

#### Message Actions
- `ADD_USER_MESSAGE`: User sends a new message (requires response handling)
- `CLEAR_MESSAGES`: Conversation history is cleared
- `SET_ACTIVE_MESSAGE`: A specific message is highlighted or focused

#### Source Actions
- `SEARCH_SOURCES`: User initiates a source search (requires source retrieval)
- `CLEAR_SOURCES`: All sources are removed from the state
- `SET_SELECTED_SOURCE`: User selects a specific source for detailed viewing
- `SET_ACTIVE_SOURCES`: Multiple sources are activated for context
- `SET_FILTER_SOURCES`: Sources are filtered based on criteria
- `RESET_FILTER_SOURCES`: Source filters are cleared

Each action type has a specific structure and expected response format. For example, `ADD_USER_MESSAGE` typically returns both a response and sources, while `SET_SELECTED_SOURCE` might return source data for the selected document.

## State Management

Lexio manages several key state elements:

- **Messages**: The conversation history between user and AI
- **Sources**: Retrieved documents or text snippets
- **Selected Source**: Currently focused source for detailed viewing
- **Active Sources**: Sources currently being used for context
- **Loading State**: Indicates ongoing operations
- **Error State**: Captures and displays errors

## Advanced Concepts

### üí¨ Response Handling

- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time, incremental responses using AsyncIterable
- **Source Updates During Streaming**: Adding or updating sources during streaming
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for various failure scenarios
- **Timeouts**: Configurable timeouts for requests and streaming

### ‚öôÔ∏è Action Flow Customization

- **Blocking vs. Non-blocking Actions**: Some actions block the UI during processing
- **Lazy Loading**: Lazy loading of sources and data
- **Follow-up Actions**: Chain multiple actions together for complex workflows
- **Custom Action Types**: Define your own action types for specialized behavior

### üé® Customization and Theming

- **Component Customization**: Override styles for individual components
- **Global Theme**: Apply consistent styling across all components
- **Custom Components**: Build your own components using Lexio's hooks

## üîå Integration Patterns

- **Backend Integration**: Connect to any RAG backend (LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom)
- **Authentication**: Pass authentication tokens through your action handler
- **Stateful vs. Stateless**: Choose between maintaining state on client or server
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple and add advanced features as needed
