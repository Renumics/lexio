# üöÄ Welcome to Lexio

Lexio is a powerful React library for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) interfaces. It handles complex workflows out of the box while remaining simple to use and highly customizable.

It supports multiple document types (**PDF**, **HTML**, **Markdown**, **Text**, **Excel**) with advanced features like streaming responses, source highlighting, and a comprehensive state management system.

Developers can use ready-made components or easily build custom ones using React hooks and the flexible action handler pattern.

## Quick Start

You can install the library with npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install lexio
```

To use the GUI components, you need to provide an action handler to the `LexioProvider` context:

```tsx
import { 
  LexioProvider, 
  ChatWindow, 
  AdvancedQueryField, 
  SourcesDisplay, 
  ContentDisplay, 
  ErrorDisplay 
} from 'lexio';

const App = () => (
  <LexioProvider
    onAction={(action, messages, sources, activeSources, selectedSource) => {
      // Handle user messages
      if (action.type === 'ADD_USER_MESSAGE') {
        return {
          // Return sources as a Promise that resolves to Source[]
          sources: Promise.resolve([
            {
              id: crypto.randomUUID(),
              title: "Example Document",
              type: "pdf",
              relevance: 0.95,
              metadata: {
                author: "Documentation Team",
                page: 3
              }
            }
          ]),
          // Return a response as a Promise or use streaming
          response: Promise.resolve("This is a sample response based on the retrieved documents.")
        };
      }
      
      // Handle source selection
      if (action.type === 'SET_SELECTED_SOURCE' && action.sourceObject) {
        return {
          sourceData: fetchSourceContent(action.sourceObject.id)
        };
      }
      
      return undefined;
    }}
  >
    <div className="flex flex-col h-screen">
      <div className="flex-1">
        <ChatWindow markdown={true} />
      </div>
      <div>
        <AdvancedQueryField />
      </div>
      <div className="flex">
        <SourcesDisplay />
        <ContentDisplay />
      </div>
    </div>
    <ErrorDisplay />
  </LexioProvider>
);
```

## Dependencies

Lexio has minimal core dependencies, but some advanced components require additional packages that are not installed by default:

- **SpreadsheetViewer**: For Excel/spreadsheet file viewing, you'll need to install:
  ```bash
  npm install exceljs xlsx @tanstack/react-table @tanstack/react-virtual
  ```

- **Explanations Module**: For advanced explanation features, you'll need to install:
  ```bash
  npm install compromise js-tiktoken sbd @types/sbd
  ```

These dependencies are dynamically imported when the components are used, but you must install them yourself to avoid runtime errors.

## Key Features

- **Action Handler Pattern**: A flexible pattern for handling user interactions and state updates
- **Powerful Components**: Pre-built components for chat interfaces, source selection, and document viewing with highlighting
- **Integrated State Management**: Transparent state handling for seamless interaction between components
- **Streaming Responses**: Support for real-time, incremental responses with source updates
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Built-in error handling and timeout management
- **Highly Customizable**: Theming and component customization options

## Advantages

- **Quick Implementation**: Get your RAG interface running with just a few lines of code
- **Production Ready**: Built for integration into mature web applications
- **Best Practices Built-in**: Follows RAG implementation patterns from real-world applications
- **Framework Agnostic Backend**: Works with any backend RAG implementation (LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom solutions)
- **Flexible Architecture**: Adapt to various use cases from simple chat to complex document analysis
