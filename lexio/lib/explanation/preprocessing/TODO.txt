Preprocessing:
- intersection.ts finish
- using  kmeans from 'ml-kmeans' for better header-detection (but it could be heavy -> check). Think about header detection necessity at all -- could be 
useful for heuristic more effective matching. For now we just filter them out as they will give higher score during search 
- add filtering rule for 
    -values on the bottom (page numbers)
    -cases with "Height: 0px" (plot labels)
    -all axes name and plot labels
    -handle reference area correctly (now [num] and reference iself are in 2 separate columns so it should be somehow handled (i quess just by y coordinate
        but it needs extra check and time))



! - rename "withmarker" from parser file
