Preprocessing:
- intersection.ts finish
- using  kmeans from 'ml-kmeans' for better header-detection (but it could be heavy -> check). Think about header detection necessity at all -- could be 
useful for heuristic more effective matching. For now we just filter them out as they will give higher score during search 




! - rename "withmarker" from parser file
